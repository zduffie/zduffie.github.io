		<h1>COVID shakes NY and NYC </h1>

    <br>

		<p>It seems so long ago, yet like not much time has passed at all. As the county begins to move on from the COVID crisis, so many questions are still being asked. For my research this week, I wanted to create graphs that depicted the trends of COVID in NYC and New York state. These numbers and graphs truly helped put the pandemic into persepctive for me. Being in my small bubble back home in Illinois made the pandemic seem so much smaller. These numbers reminded me how much of a global crisis this truly was. </p>

    <p>Researchers wanted to know what month between the years of 2020 and 2021 had the most positive cases of COVID. Data shows that there were the most positive cases found in both NY and NYC. There were 200,562 cases in the city of New York and 393,501 cases in New York. While there were over 400,000 cases found in January, that number only accounts for 2021, as data for COVID began being collected in March of 2020. The reason for this trend can be due to the influx of cases that shook the nation at the very start of the pandemic when people were still trying to understand exactly what was going on.</p>

    <p>The number of COVID tests administered in 2020 grew by millions in just a span of a few months. This makes sense, as the country was on a quest to find answers. The number of tests administered state-wide were about 3 million more than tests that were administered in the city of New York. Data here focuses on 2020, just as the world learned of COVID. At the start of the summer, their were over a million COVID tests administered and by the end of the summer, this number nearly doubled.</p>
